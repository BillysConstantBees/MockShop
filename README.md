This web app is being used for a moch tech interview. And must meet the following 5 requirements:

1. Have a pre-populated (hard coded) array of objects as products.
/* I beleive i achived this goal as the 4 products display on the page*/

2. Your product display should have (not limited to) product image,
product name, product price
/* Each product has an img, name, description price and add to cart button*/

3. All products should be displayed when the page loads
/* the products on screen load along with button functionality however cart is not stored in local */

4. Using an ‘add to cart’ button, the user should be able to add the
products to a shopping cart list
/* Items are added to cart when button is clicked */

5. The shopping cart lists all products and displays a the total price
/* price is totaled after the add to cart button is clicked and every 5 seconds*/


========================================

The following are "Stretch Goals":

6. The user should also be able to delete the products from the cart, thus
modifying the total price of the cart


7. The user should be able to enter a quantity for each product


========================================

One should be able to download the github repository and open the app using shop.html.

This app uses:
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

========================================

What I would do if I had more time/continued the project:
- I would attempt to meet the stretch goals:
    + Add a remove/Delete button to remove from cart
    + Add quantity to add multiple of one item without making multiple <divs>. I would also probably change it so instead it adds to the quantity rather than adding a new div.
- Neaten it up
- Add a purchase button that empties the cart.
    + In a larger project I would go to a different page and have a purchase details page/popup.
